        Hi, I am Callum, an Irish man living abroad moved here about 10 years and I am able to speak some Gaelic but not a lot, my favourite past time is hang with a few mates at a bar.<br>
        The results of the test show that I am good at working as a team, always open to new ideas and pay attention to my team how they are doing and always keep tabs on every part<br>
        of the project, so we do not fall behind. The biggest flaws are I am a overthink, get stressed easily and can find it had to sit down and focus on a single task<br>
        for a long without getting distracted. It means the best way for me to study and learn is watching tutorials and step by steps with visual ad and they best way for me to take notes<br>
        is key bullet points that can be put on cue cards to help memorizes.<br>
        I chose to do an alignment chart as my third test seem like a good choice since there are many different options you can get. Being neutral means,<br>
        I have no real bias towards anything and can see both sides to any story. </p>

        <p>Hello, my name is James Buckman I am currently studying at RMIT, my student number is s3494024 and my student email address is:  s3494024@student.rmit.edu.au<br>
            I was born in Gosford NSW Australia on the 26th of July 1993 and I have lived in Australia my entire life.<br>
            I left school at year 11 after having to go back to year 10 after leaving a state school and enrolling in a private school due to the way that school functioned.<br>
            so after getting half-way through year 11 then going back to year 10, I decided once I got to year 11 the second time that I have had enough.<br>
            I only speak English, I knew some cantonese years ago due to my best friend at the time teaching me his language but I have forgotten all of it<br>
             due to not practicing the language in years.<br>
            Some interesting fact about me is I have played guitar since I was 6 years old, I have 4 pet pythons named, Zia, Lia, Midas and Crowley and I enjoy playing video games.<br>
             I play Dota2, Call Of Duty, Sea Of Thieves and my favorite would still have to be The Witcher 3 even though I have not and probably will never complete it.
            </p>
